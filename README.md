# Election SQLite Loader


<a id="org4dcbcaa"></a>

## General

The following is a "quick & dirty" ballot tallying program for the benefit
of some troubled high rise community in the North East of the USA. Data
entry is optimized for the use of "blind" right-hand PC numeric-pad typing.
This program uses the SQLite data base and is written in C. To examine
collected votes use a program like [SQLITEbrowser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) on the database file.

This community votes through weighted shares.
